# Status — read this second (after CLAUDE.md)

Where the project stands and what comes next. Update it whenever a phase, a decision or the
work queue changes. History lives in `reports/phase_<n>.md`; rules in `CLAUDE.md`; the full spec
in `docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md`; the code map in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

_Last updated: 2026-10-10._

## Work queue (in order)

### A. Before Phase 5 starts (reviewer decisions, 2026-10-10)

1. ~~**Prospective loss budget**~~ — **done** (c76a9d5, ADR-0010 amended).
   `remaining = limit − loss to date − open risk` per daily and weekly limit; loss to date =
   −(closed P&L + open P&L); open risk = further loss from the current exit price (bid for a
   BUY, ask for a SELL) to each stop, plus exit commission and stop slippage; a stopless
   position or a missing/stale quote rejects. Fault test
   `test_a_trade_that_would_overrun_the_daily_limit_is_rejected`.
2. ~~**Parity check additions**~~ — **done**. `ParityReport.ok` = equal in-window trade counts
   (explicit `trade_count_matches`) + every trade paired and within field tolerances (1 s,
   1 point, same exit reason, $0.02) + |Σ net Aurum − Σ net tester| ≤
   `Tolerance.cumulative_money` ($0.02, separate, never count × $0.02), totals over every
   in-window trade. `parity.json` carries counts, totals, difference, tolerance and booleans.
   The tester settings that must match (commission, leverage, deposit, modelling, delays) are
   a table in `docs/strategies/reference_fixed_time.md`. Never loosen a tolerance to pass.
3. ~~**Cancel inside a bar**~~ — **done** (Phase 4 issue 7, ADR-0009 §5). On bars, a cancel
   arriving inside a bar that reaches the pending entry: opened through the level → filled
   first, not flagged; only the range reached it → assumed filled first (worst case),
   `intrabar_rule = cancel_bar`, `worst_case = true`, kept over any same-bar exit; not reached
   → cancelled. Freeze level only if still pending. Ticks keep the exact order. Summary key
   `intrabar_cancel_bar`. Golden scenario `cancel_and_entry_in_one_bar` (14th).
4. **Phase 3b (Dukascopy) trigger** — record in ADR-0008/0009 and enforce in the Phase 5 report:
   open Phase 3b if a candidate has **> 1%** of trades decided by the worst-case rule, **or** if
   flipping every flagged trade to its best case changes the **sign of net P&L or the pass/fail
   verdict**.
5. **Stop-size cap in every strategy spec.** At 0.25% of $10k ($25 budget) a stop needs
   ≲ $20–25 at 0.01 lot or the risk engine rejects every trade (all 1,524 14:30 SELLs of the
   reference strategy were rejected: 3,000 points ≈ $30). Add the cap to
   `docs/STRATEGY_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`.
6. **CI** (GitHub Actions or similar: ruff, format check, mypy, pytest on Linux/macOS). "Windows
   only, no CI" is the weakest point of Phase 4. MT5 tests auto-skip off Windows.

### B. Later, tracked

- Adopted positions (state file lost) get no timeout/invalidation, only force-flat + kill
  switch. Acceptable on demo; **fix before any live pilot** (Phase 4 issue 5).
- If Aurum ever trades several symbols at once, `risk.policy.open_risk()` must take a fresh
  quote and `SymbolSpec` per position's symbol instead of one shared `Tick`/`SymbolSpec`.
- Margin estimate vs `order_calc_margin` — Phase 8 (Phase 4 issue 1).
- Watchdog scheduling waits for the Phase 7/8 trader loops (Phase 4 issue 6).
- Add each year's FOMC dates to `configs/risk.yaml` in time (`aurum doctor` warns 60 days
  ahead; current list ends 2026-12-09) and future market holidays to `configs/data.yaml`.

### C. User actions (not Claude's)

- **Tester run**: second MT5 in portable mode (`terminal64.exe /portable`, separate folder, own
  data dir) so the live collector keeps running. Run `mql5/AurumReference.mq5`, export deals CSV
  + HTML report, then `aurum backtest parity 20261009T221629Z_reference_fixed_time_m5_be6c94
  <deals.csv>`. Steps and the settings that must match: `docs/strategies/reference_fixed_time.md`.
- **Mac checks**: `uv run ruff check && uv run mypy && uv run pytest` (only ever run on the VM).

## Phase 5 conditions (from the reviewer; part of the gate)

- Write each strategy spec (`docs/STRATEGY_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`) **before any code**, including the
  stop-size cap. The reviewer offered to draft the trend-pullback spec — ask the user.
- Every trial in the ledger. A **hold-out period** never touched during search.
- Report **gross vs net**. Apply a **Deflated-Sharpe-style** correction to the best candidate.
- Judge M15-direct vs M5-trigger on **net expectancy and drawdown after costs**, not win rate.
- **Null baseline**: `reference_fixed_time` with the policy risk engine, 2020-11-12 … 2026-10-08,
  run `…233326910002Z_reference_fixed_time_m5_ae3d92`: 1,520 trades, **−$381.76**, max DD 5.4%.
  This is what no edge looks like after costs; judge every candidate against it. Rerun on
  c76a9d5 (prospective budget) as `20261010T002425547831Z_reference_fixed_time_m5_3322ec`:
  byte-identical trades (sha256 `447228f1…`). The budget never binds for this strategy (at
  most one ~$20 trade a day, far from the $250 weekly limit).

## Environment facts

- This checkout runs on the **Windows 11 ARM VM** (`C:\code\aurum`), venv `C:\venvs\aurum`
  (x64 Python under emulation), data `C:\aurum-data` (`AURUM_DATA_DIR`). The live tick
  collector runs there continuously; don't stop it.
- Backtest runs: `reports/runs/<run_id>/` (git-ignored). Trial ledger: `<data>/ledger/`.
- Test suite: ~380 tests, ~70 s with coverage, 92% coverage. Keep it lean (see `CLAUDE.md`).
